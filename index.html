		&nbsp;
		<p>Students of level 3 vocationally related Computing/IT courses often enter the course with very little idea of 
		what it means to work in the IT industry. Students can suffer from low levels of motivation, which may be caused 
		by an inability to see the purpose of their learning in relation to a career path. Their learning is focused in 
		one area, whose relevance may not be apparent or appreciated. This is not learning for the sake of furthering a 
		general education, neither is it training for a specific job. It is somewhere in between.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a shortage of suitably skilled employees in the IT industry and, 
		therefore, an increase in employer input and support is highly desirable. There is a growing involvement in 
		computing from major employers such as Google, O2 and others, which is aimed mostly at schools, but for many 
		colleges, local employers are mostly SMEs with little time and without the staff to take on an education liaison 
		role.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>This project aimed to <em>study the effect on motivation of using assessment material in the form of a 
		competition, which will follow a brief agreed and set by employers and college staff</em>. The assessment 
		brief was delivered to two groups of students on the second year of a BTEC Level 3 course in IT.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Motivation was measured by examining the proportion of students who met deadlines on non-employer-led 
		assignments and employer-led, competitive assignments and by collating and recording attitudes towards assessment 
		exercises before and after the activity. It is anticipated that a learning/assessment activity for all students, 
		such as an employer set and supported competition, due to its link to the real world, would raise motivation 
		levels for students and would be manageable, inclusive and attractive to employers. It was not within the scope
		of this project to assess employer attitudes towards this type of activity as it would only be possible to 
		involve one or two employers, as brief setters and as competition judges. However, the views of the employers involved 
		do form part of the project evaluation.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<p>Activities of this type have been used before and students, especially high achievers, have expressed a liking 
		for this type of assessment. However, the effects on all students in a cohort have not been measured and, in 
		particular, the effect on those with low motivation levels has not yet been considered. This project <em>aims 
		to study the effect on motivation levels of all students in a cohort in terms of meeting deadlines and attempting 
		all parts of the activity.</em></p>
